# simple-qtcountdwn
This is my first program. It's a countdown timer written in Qt.
It can run up to 99 days with adjustable speed from 100 milliseconds to 60 seconds per tick.
It support 2 languages: English and Vietnamese. Make sure your system supports Unicode

## Note:
Because it was originally written for AM335x Starter Kit with a screen of 480x272, to get code for a window-sized version, check out windowSize branch
