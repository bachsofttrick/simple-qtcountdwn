# simple-qtcountdwn
This is my first program. It's a countdown timer written in Qt.
It can run up to 99 days with adjustable speed from 100 milliseconds to 60 seconds per tick.
It support 2 languages: English and Vietnamese. Make sure your system supports Unicode.

## Note:
Code has been updated to include options for fullscreen or windowed.\n
This version is for AM335x Starter Kit. It will be included with LED and button interactions.
